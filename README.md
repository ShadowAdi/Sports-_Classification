# CNN - Sports Classification
CNN or Convolutional Neural Network also belongs to family of neural network but they play a big role when it comes to working with Images and Videos or any Grid like data.

ANN can also be used for images but they don’t able to get those great results.

In this blog I am not going to talk about why CNN is used and why ther are used. So you should probably have to know about the CNN , their importance and how they work. We are going to talk about EfficientNetB0(you can see the research paper).

EfficientNetB0 Or ENB0 belongs to family of CNN Used to solve a problem related to Images by Google. This Model was presented by Google.

Let’s Now talk about what i am going to do. As I Say Earlier CNN works for Image. So what can we do well we can do Object Detection, Segmentation and Classification on Images based on Objects. i.e., Image contains a cat and a dog your model able to predict whether it is cat or dog. Simple right Not that. Our Model don’t know about cat or dog. So We use feature extraction for this.

We are going to perform Sports Classification(You can see project on Github). Our Model going to help us to predict 100 different sports from an image.
